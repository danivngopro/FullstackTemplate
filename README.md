## Overview

This template provides a solid foundation for fullstack web applications. The front-end leverages modern React patterns with TypeScript for type safety, while the back-end employs Express for API development, Docker for containerization, MongoDB for data storage, and Zod for validating incoming requests. Whether you're building a small project or a scalable enterprise solution, this template is designed to help you get started quickly and maintain high code quality.

## Technologies

### Front-End

- **React:** A powerful library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript:** Provides strong typing to enhance development efficiency and code quality.

### Back-End

- **Express:** A fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **TypeScript:** Ensures consistency and robustness in your server-side code.
- **Docker:** Containerizes your application to ensure consistency across environments.
- **MongoDB:** A flexible NoSQL database for modern applications.
- **Zod:** A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library that ensures your API receives valid data.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for containerized back-end development)
- MongoDB (or use a Docker container for MongoDB)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### Set Up the Front-End

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Set Up the Back-End

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

## Usage

### Running the Front-End

Start the development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

The app will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or another port if configured).

### Running the Back-End

#### Using Docker

In the `backend` directory, run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command builds and runs both your Express server and MongoDB in containers.

#### Without Docker

1. Make sure MongoDB is running locally.
2. In the `backend` directory, run:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start the back-end server in development mode.

### Building for Production

#### Front-End

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

#### Back-End

```bash
cd backend
npm run build
```

Then start the production server with:

```bash
npm start
```
